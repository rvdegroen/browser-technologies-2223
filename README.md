# Survey Minor Web Development

This project is a survey for students who participated in the Minor in Web Development. The goal of this survey is to provide teachers with insight into how students experienced the minor and its different subjects.

* It is important to note that this survey has no back-end and is therefore not fully functional. It is simply a concept and a project for the subject 'Browser Technologies' in the Minor in Web Development.

## Progressive Enhancement ✔

Progressive enhancement is a design approach where a website should work on all browsers and devices with all its basic functionalities. Please look at the 'core functionalities' and 'features' that are necessary for my project, specifically regarding surveys and accessibility. 

## Core Functionalities of the Survey ✔

Surveys are used to gain knowledge. I made a list of this survey's core functionalities to help me decide which features to add. The core functionalities of this survey are:

1. Being able to fill in your personal information, such as your name and your student ID. 
2. Being able to fill in forms for different subject. 
3. Being able to fill in who your teachers were in each subject.
4. Being able to choose which semester you followed the minor.
5. Being able to rate the subject from 1 to 10. 
6. Being able to rate the lectures from 1 to 10. 
7. Being able to rate your personal understanding of the subject from 1 to 10. 
8. Being able to submit your form.
9. Being able to see user feedback, when the user needs feedback (e.g. when something isn't filled in, but needs to be filled in). 
10. Being able to see your progress when filling in the form. 
11. Being able to use the form when Javascript is turned off.
12. Being able to use the form when CSS is turned off. 

## Process

In this section, I will talk about the process of this whole project. 

### Sketching

For this survey, I started with sketching out my form and thinking how I wanted the questions to be grouped or split up, with the thought of progressive disclosure. Here you can see my sketches below:
